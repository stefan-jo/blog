I am an experienced Data Scientist, AI Engineer and Applied LLM Researcher. I work with language models since 2018 and lead research efforts for training custom language models from scratch on geospatial telecommunications data at O2 Czech Republic. My recent focus has been on retrieval models, rerankers, evaluations, synthetic data generation and agentic search applications.

Originally from Germany, I settled in beautiful Prague, Czech Republic. I like learning new things, craft beer, specialty coffee and spending time with my family. I proudly consider myself a repeated [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) alumn and follow everything Jeremy Howard now does at [Answer.AI](https://www.answer.ai/) with enthusiasm.
