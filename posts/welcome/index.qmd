Welcome to my blog! Check this short post about what you can expect to read here. *Hint: it's all about retrieval.*

I will finally kick off this blog and plan to post about these topics in the following weeks and months:

 * how are retrieval models trained?
 * how do late interaction models work?
 * what are the latest trends in retrieval?

These posts will include paper reviews, tutorials and research. 

Looking back at the two old posts below from 2020, when I was still relatively new in the field, I can say that *a lot* as changed since then. We have a lot to cover, so let's not waste any time and get right to it. 

Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoy it!
